" For automated FUSE mounts, you must register an extension with FILETYPE=..
" in one of following formats:
"
" :filetype extensions FUSE_MOUNT|some_mount_command using %SOURCE_FILE and %DESTINATION_DIR variables
" %SOURCE_FILE and %DESTINATION_DIR are filled in by vifm at runtime.
" A sample line might look like this:
" :filetype *.zip,*.jar,*.war,*.ear FUSE_MOUNT|fuse-zip %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR

" filetype *.tar.gz,*.tgz FUSE_MOUNT|archivemount %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR

filetype *.zip,*.jar,*.war,*.ear,*.ja,*.xpi FUSE_MOUNT|fuse-zip %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR

filetype *.rar FUSE_MOUNT|unrar x %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR

" mount the ISO 9660 file system
filetype *.iso FUSE_MOUNT|fuseiso %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR
" This command only mounts CD images in the ISO 9660 file system.
" It can't mount DVD images, which are usually formatted in the UDF file system.
" Mount them manually with the command: `mount -t udf,iso9660 <image> <mountpoint>'.

"
" :filetype extensions FUSE_MOUNT2|some_mount_command using %PARAM and %DESTINATION_DIR variables
" %PARAM and %DESTINATION_DIR are filled in by vifm at runtime.
" A sample line might look like this:
" :filetype *.ssh FUSE_MOUNT2|sshfs %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR
" %PARAM value is filled from the first line of file (whole line).
" Example first line for SshMount filetype: root@127.0.0.1:/

" You can also add %CLEAR if you want to clear screen before running FUSE
" program.
